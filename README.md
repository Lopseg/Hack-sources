# Payloads
Accuratted list of payloads that i developed over my life
Here i include some reverse_shell payloads built in python and cpp
Also, some of them use some kind of encrypting/encoding to bypass some IDS's

Feel free to fork it and/or help me increase this list.

For encryption/encoding there are some ones using:
Eliptic curve cryptography
ROT13
