# Payloads
Accuratted list of payloads that i developed over my life.

(and there is some other ones that i've founded over the internet).

Feel free to fork it and/or help me increase this list.

Also, some of them use some kind of encrypting/encoding to bypass some IDS's.


For encryption/encoding there are some ones using

Eliptic curve cryptography
ROT13
Base64


I'm still developping some of them, or trying to find, so of course i didn't cover every test case, but for the basic purpose of executing comands they are so much usefull.

Take a look at my <a href=https://dealwithrafa.wordpress.com>blog</a>
